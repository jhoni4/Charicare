        <p><b>ETHIOPIA AND THE ELDERLY</b>
Ethiopia has a growing population of elderly people. According to the BBC, the population of the elderly is expected to grow 55% by 2050. As this population increases, so do the number of poor, homeless, and hungry elderly.</p>
        <p><b>LACK OF SUPPORT</b>
There is no provision for programs of social security or other financial support for the elderly. Many are unable to work due to illness or age. These elderly are unable to care for themselves and their grandchildren.</p>
